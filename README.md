## Overview
With rideshare services growing in popularity each year, it is essential to do a deep dive into the data. This comparitive analysis was done using data from three different types of cities: Rural, Suburban, and Urban. The overall analysis and visualizations of data done can help reveal trends and correlation of city type and the number of drivers and riders, and the impact it can have on the fare amount. 

## Results

### Breakdown by City Type

According to the data presented in the table above, it can be concluded that the Urban cities had the highest number of rides. Urban cities also had the highest number of drivers, with the drivers earning on average the lowest amount per ride when compared to Rural and Suburban cities. From the data presented in the table above, it can also be concluded that while Rural cities had the lowest amount of rides, they also had on average the highest fare per ride, and the highest average fare paid per driver. 

### Total Fare by City Type

According to the data presented in the graph, it can be concluded that fare prices for all three city types began to peak in late February before dipping in early March. Leading into April, it can be concluded that fare prices for Urban cities slowly started to rise. In Rural cities we can tell from the graph that fare prices slowly started to decrease. In Suburban cities in April, fares slightly decreased before increasing later into April. 


## Summary 

Based on the results from the data the following recommendations can be made to address disparities between city types:

1. As Rural cities tend to have the least amount of rides and on average the highest fares, a loyalty program could be implemended rewarding users in rural cities with discounts and incentives to increase the amount of rides they take. 
2. For Urban cities, finding out which cities have hotspots and further delving into that data might be more helpful in determining length of trips and which specific areas riders are requesting. 
3. Looking at surge pricing and how it specifically affects all three city types can help address the disparity between the fare pricing, amount of drivers in a city, total rides, and average fare per driver. 

### For Further Consideration

After doing an analysis on the provided data, in order to truly determine the disparities between the three city type and to delve even further into Urban cities, more data is needed. I would suggest comparing data year over year, in order to see if the amount of riders and fare price is increasing or decreasing.
